# Maketing analysis
This project is my attempt to conduct a real-life market research based on a ready-made dataset.
## Aim
As a marketing analyst, I need to analyze a data set to understand the problem of recent underperforming marketing campaigns and come up with data-driven solutions.
To achieve the goal, the notebook was divided into three parts with more detailed questions in each.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Statistical Analysis
3. Data Visualization
## Data 
You can find .csv in the repo `marketing_data.csv`. 
## Used libraries
Pandas, shap, eli5, scipy, Seaborn, Plotly
